# Tutorial_MLbasics

## Repository to keep track of ML tutorials
## Contains the following:
- Writing a basic NN, backpropagation and training with just numpy
- DNN , CNN using tensorflow/keras (have to update)
- DNN , CNN using pytorch 

Parts of the tutorial uses data generated using included scripts
For the rest data should be downloaded from : https://shghosh.web.cern.ch/shghosh/CODE_SAMPLES/
- output0.csv (training) (label 0,1 for pi0, photon resp.)
- output1.csv (testing)

These datasets correspond to photons and pi0 showers in CMS ECAL like calorimeter
